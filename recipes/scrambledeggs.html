            <h5>IMPORTANT NOTES</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the eggs are mixed before they're poured into skillet.
                If they're mixed in skillet they wont have the same texture.</li>
                <li>Also ensure the butter is browned for the flavor, and the pan needs
                to be very hot before cooking the eggs. If they are slowly cooked it
                will also change the texture.</li>
